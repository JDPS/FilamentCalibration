# FilamentCalibration
Filament calibration settings for my two printers, specifically flow ratio and pressure advance.


Current Update: August 2023
Motive: replace a faulty part cooling fan in X1CC and tweak the S1Pro with two 5015 fans.
Also, BL's new firmware (software) results in different calibration settings.

  Settings are available in a .xlsx file:
